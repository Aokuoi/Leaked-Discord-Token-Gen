This is a request gen that I have decided to leak. I am sick of seeing money hungry idiots
selling these for 5k + and genuienly hate the "token" community so much that I hope this helps
prevent these idiots making some money.

These steps are from my understanding of it:

1) Allow app to make changes to device / admin approval, this just allows the program to send requests

2) Put proxies in proxy.txt - proxy format is user:pass@ip:port or ip:port

3) Put mail accounts in mail.txt - mail format is mail:pass format

4) Captcha service + api in config.yml
